## Blog

# Setup
- [ ] Clone this repository in your localhost
- [ ] Create a folder called blog "blog" 
- [ ] Make sure you have the url http://localhost/blog/ available
- [ ] Import the database *blog_2015-01-25.sql* or run the migrations/seeders from Laravel
- [ ] http://localhost/blog/ should now be up and running, alternatively a vhost could be created but the base href in the html should then be removed.


Cheers!
